This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I had gotten behind in my understanding. This homework assignment has provided a great opportunity to read through many of the mongoDB, mongoose and React exercises. Furthermore, I had the chance to print and analyze Radhika Sivarajan's work on this very assignment. 

If you look at my code, you will see many similarities. I copied and pasted code as I understood it. My app isn't working, but there are some successes and I've learned a great deal!
